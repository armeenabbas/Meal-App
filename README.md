Building the 'Find Meals For Your Ingredients' App

Step 1: Set Up Your Project

Create a new directory for your project on your local machine.
Inside this directory, create three files: index.html, style.css, and script.js.
Add the provided HTML code to the index.html file.
Write your CSS styles in the style.css file to style the form, search results, and modal popup.
Step 2: Implement the HTML Structure

Use the provided HTML structure as the foundation of your app. This includes elements for entering ingredients, a button for submitting searches, and sections for displaying search results and meal details.
Step 3: Add External Resources

Include links to external CSS frameworks like Font Awesome for icons and any other libraries you might need for UI components.
Ensure that the viewport and character encoding meta tags are correctly set in your HTML for proper rendering on all devices.
Step 4: Write the JavaScript Functionality

Implement the JavaScript provided which includes:
Event listeners for the search button and meal details.
Functions to fetch meal data from TheMealDB API using the ingredient entered by the user.
Functions to display the meals fetched and handle user interactions like displaying and closing the recipe modal.
Step 5: Connect to TheMealDB API

Utilize fetch to connect to TheMealDB API and retrieve meal data based on user input. Handle the response and update the DOM with the meal options or an error message if no meals are found.
Ensure error handling is in place for failed API calls.
Step 6: Test the Application

Open your index.html in a browser to test the functionality of your app.
Enter an ingredient and click the search button to see if the meal results populate correctly.
Click on a meal to see if the details are displayed correctly in a modal.
Test the close functionality of the modal to ensure it works as expected.
Step 7: Debug and Optimize

Check for any issues or bugs in the app and fix them. Look for errors in the console and ensure the API fetch operation works smoothly.
Optimize the CSS for better responsiveness and ensure compatibility across different browsers and devices.
Step 8: Deployment

Once the application is working correctly and styled appropriately, consider deploying it online.
Use platforms like GitHub Pages, Netlify, or Vercel to host your web application so it's accessible to others on the internet.
